# Implementing Neural Networks In A Quantum Computer
This research paper was written at the ZHAW in our penultimate semester of our BSc CS degree course. 
Many thanks go out to the creator of the initial LaTeX template we used for this, [@matteodelucchi](https://github.com/matteodelucchi). The original can be found [here](https://github.com/matteodelucchi/ZHAW_thesis-template). Our usage was adapted for the PA every undergraduate (that isn't parttime _and_ dispensated from doing it) has to do and will find it's way back as a fork once we have finished our work.
