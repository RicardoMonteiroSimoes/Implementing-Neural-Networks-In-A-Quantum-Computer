Hence, it is critical to choose the most appropriate activation function in neural networks calculation. Acharya et al. (2018) suggest that numerous recipes have been formulated over the years, though some of them are considered deprecated these days since they are unable to operate properly under some conditions. These functions have a variety of characteristics, which are deemed essential to successfully learning. Their monotonicity, individual derivatives, and finite of their range are some of these characteristics (Bach 2017). This research paper will evaluate the commonly used additive functions, such as swish, {ReLU}, Sigmoid, and so forth. This will be followed by their properties, own cons and pros, and particular formula application recommendations.},

	abstract = {Quantum computing promises to solve difficult optimization problems in chemistry, physics and mathematics more efficiently than classical computers, but requires fault-tolerant quantum computers with millions of qubits. To overcome errors introduced by today's quantum computers, hybrid algorithms combining classical and quantum computers are used. In this paper we tackle the multiple query optimization problem ({MQO}) which is an important {NP}-hard problem in the area of data-intensive problems. We propose a novel hybrid classical-quantum algorithm to solve the {MQO} on a gate-based quantum computer. We perform a detailed experimental evaluation of our algorithm and compare its performance against a competing approach that employs a quantum annealer -- another type of quantum computer. Our experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm currently can only handle small problem sizes due to the limited number of qubits available on a gate-based quantum computer compared to a quantum computer based on quantum annealing. However, our algorithm shows a qubit efficiency of close to 99\% which is almost a factor of 2 higher compared to the state of the art implementation. Finally, we analyze how our algorithm scales with larger problem sizes and conclude that our approach shows promising results for near-term quantum computers.},

In many settings --- most prominently in so-called parametrized or variational algorithms --- the objective function is a result of hybrid quantum-classical processing. To optimize the objective, it is useful to have access to exact gradients of quantum circuits with respect to gate parameters. This paper shows how gradients of expectation values of quantum measurements can be estimated using the same, or almost the same, architecture that executes the original circuit. It generalizes previous results for qubit-based platforms, and proposes recipes for the computation of gradients of continuous-variable circuits. Interestingly, in many important instances it is sufficient to run the original quantum circuit twice while shifting a single gate parameter to obtain the corresponding component of the gradient. More general cases can be solved by conditioning a single gate on an ancilla.},

    abstract = {Abstract As quantum computers are based on the laws of quantum mechanics, they are capable of solving certain problems faster than their classical counterparts. However, quantum algorithms with a theoretical speed-up often assume that data can be loaded efficiently. In general, the runtime complexity of the loading routine depends on (i) the data encoding that defines how the data is represented by the state of the quantum computer and (ii) the data itself. In some cases, loading the data requires at least exponential time that destroys a potential speed-up. And especially for the first generation of devices that are currently available, the resources (qubits and operations) needed to encode the data are limited. In this work, we, therefore, present six patterns that describe how data is handled by quantum computers.},

However, the computational cost to load classical data in quantum computers can impose restrictions on possible quantum speedups. Known algorithms to create arbitrary quantum states require quantum circuits with depth O(N) to load an N-dimensional vector. Here, we show that it is possible to load an N-dimensional vector with exponential time advantage using a quantum circuit with polylogarithmic depth and entangled information in ancillary qubits. Results show that we can efficiently load data in quantum devices using a divide-and-conquer strategy to exchange computational time for space. We demonstrate a proof of concept on a real quantum device and present two applications for quantum machine learning. We expect that this new loading strategy allows the quantum speedup of tasks that require to load a significant volume of information to quantum devices.},

Thus, various factors contributing to the depth and width as well as to the noise of an implementation of a gate-based algorithm must be understood in order to assess whether an implementation will execute successfully on a given NISQ device. In this contribution, we discuss these factors and their impact on algorithm implementations. Especially, we will cover state preparation, oracle expansion, connectivity, circuit rewriting, and readout: these factors are very often ignored when presenting a gate-based algorithm but they are crucial when implementing such an algorithm on near-term quantum computers. Our contribution will help developers in charge of realizing gate-based algorithms on such machines in (i) achieving an executable implementation, and (ii) assessing the success of their implementation on a given machine.},

Machine learning became famous for such processing purpose and through unsupervised learning we are capable of processing over various data formats. Such algorithms performance is up-to the mark, but as per the availability of inherent parallel processing through quantum machines, computational speedup can be achieved by designing classical equivalent quantum machine learning algorithms.

One challenge in implementing such algorithms is to choose an effective circuit that well represents the solution space while maintaining a low circuit depth and number of parameters. To characterize and identify expressible, yet compact, parameterized circuits, we propose several descriptors, including measures of expressibility and entangling capability, that can be statistically estimated from classical simulations of parameterized quantum circuits. We compute these descriptors for different circuit structures, varying the qubit connectivity and selection of gates. From our simulations, we identify circuit fragments that perform well with respect to the descriptors. In particular, we quantify the substantial improvement in performance of two-qubit gates in a ring or all-to-all connected arrangement compared to that of those on a line. Furthermore, we quantify the improvement in expressibility and entangling capability achieved by sequences of controlled X-rotation gates compared to sequences of controlled Z-rotation gates. In addition, we investigate how expressibility "saturates" with increased circuit depth, finding that the rate and saturated-value appear to be distinguishing features of a parameterized quantum circuit template. While the correlation between each descriptor and performance of an algorithm remains to be investigated, methods and results from this study can be useful for both algorithm development and design of experiments for general variational {HQC} algorithms.},

	abstract = {Quantum computers have enabled solving problems beyond the current computers' capabilities. However, this requires handling noise arising from unwanted interactions in these systems. Several protocols have been proposed to address efficient and accurate quantum noise profiling and mitigation. In this work, we propose a novel protocol that efficiently estimates the average output of a noisy quantum device to be used for quantum noise mitigation. The multi-qubit system average behavior is approximated as a special form of a Pauli Channel where Clifford gates are used to estimate the average output for circuits of different depths. The characterized Pauli channel error rates, and state preparation and measurement errors are then used to construct the outputs for different depths thereby eliminating the need for large simulations and enabling efficient mitigation. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed protocol on four {IBM} Q 5-qubit quantum devices. Our method demonstrates improved accuracy with efficient noise characterization. We report up to 88{\textbackslash}\% and 69{\textbackslash}\% improvement for the proposed approach compared to the unmitigated, and pure measurement error mitigation approaches, respectively.},

	abstract = {Noise dominates every aspect of near-term quantum computers, rendering it exceedingly difficult to carry out even small computations. In this paper we are concerned with the modelling of noise in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum ({NISQ}) computers. We focus on three error groups that represent the main sources of noise during a computation and present quantum channels that model each source. We engineer a noise model that combines all three noise channels and simulates the evolution of the quantum computer using its calibrated error rates. We run various experiments of our model, showcasing its behaviour compared to other noise models and an {IBM} quantum computer. We find that our model provides a better approximation of the quantum computer's behaviour than the other models. Following this, we use a genetic algorithm to optimize the parameters used by our noise model, bringing the behaviour of the model even closer to the quantum computer. Finally, a comparison between the pre and postoptimization parameters reveals that, according to our model, certain operations can be more or less erroneous than the hardware-calibrated parameters show.},

	abstract = {Machine learning and quantum computing are two technologies each with the potential for altering how computation is performed to address previously untenable problems. Kernel methods for machine learning are ubiquitous for pattern recognition, with support vector machines ({SVMs}) being the most well-known method for classification problems. However, there are limitations to the successful solution to such problems when the feature space becomes large, and the kernel functions become computationally expensive to estimate. A core element to computational speed-ups afforded by quantum algorithms is the exploitation of an exponentially large quantum state space through controllable entanglement and interference. Here, we propose and experimentally implement two novel methods on a superconducting processor. Both methods represent the feature space of a classification problem by a quantum state, taking advantage of the large dimensionality of quantum Hilbert space to obtain an enhanced solution. One method, the quantum variational classifier builds on [1,2] and operates through using a variational quantum circuit to classify a training set in direct analogy to conventional {SVMs}. In the second, a quantum kernel estimator, we estimate the kernel function and optimize the classifier directly. The two methods present a new class of tools for exploring the applications of noisy intermediate scale quantum computers [3] to machine learning.},

	shorttitle = {Learning on Hardware},
	abstract = {Deep neural networks ({DNNs}) have the advantage that they can take into account a large number of parameters, which enables them to solve complex tasks. In computer vision and speech recognition, they have a better accuracy than common algorithms, and in some tasks, they boast an even higher accuracy than human experts. With the progress of {DNNs} in recent years, many other fields of application such as diagnosis of diseases and autonomous driving are taking advantage of them. The trend at {DNNs} is clear: The network size is growing exponentially, which leads to an exponential increase in computational effort and required memory size. For this reason, optimized hardware accelerators are used to increase the performance of the inference of neuronal networks. However, there are various neural network hardware accelerator platforms, such as graphics processing units ({GPUs}), application specific integrated circuits ({ASICs}) and field programmable gate arrays ({FPGAs}). Each of these platforms offer certain advantages and disadvantages. Also, there are various methods for reducing the computational effort of {DNNs}, which are differently suitable for each hardware accelerator. In this article an overview of existing neural network hardware accelerators and acceleration methods is given. Their strengths and weaknesses are shown and a recommendation of suitable applications is given. In particular, we focus on acceleration of the inference of convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}) used for image recognition tasks. Given that there exist many different hardware architectures. {FPGA}-based implementations are well-suited to show the effect of {DNN} optimization methods on accuracy and throughput. For this reason, the focus of this work is more on {FPGA}-based implementations.},

	abstract = {We introduce a quantum algorithm that produces approximate solutions for combinatorial optimization problems. The algorithm depends on a positive integer p and the quality of the approximation improves as p is increased. The quantum circuit that implements the algorithm consists of unitary gates whose locality is at most the locality of the objective function whose optimum is sought. The depth of the circuit grows linearly with p times (at worst) the number of constraints. If p is fixed, that is, independent of the input size, the algorithm makes use of efficient classical preprocessing. If p grows with the input size a different strategy is proposed. We study the algorithm as applied to {MaxCut} on regular graphs and analyze its performance on 2-regular and 3-regular graphs for fixed p. For p = 1, on 3-regular graphs the quantum algorithm always finds a cut that is at least 0.6924 times the size of the optimal cut.},
